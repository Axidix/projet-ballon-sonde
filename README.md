This project aims at studying the conditions and dynamic evolution of a balloon (similar to hot-air balloon).
The program needs a serial link with a GPS to run. The program was done with one GPS in mind (used in a larger project) so the columns may not be adapted for every devices.
The data is separated and saved in an excel file at each time iteration, and allows us to create graphics to analyse the data (for instance the evolution of temperature)
The excel file should already be existant, but we can simulate the serial link and try any data thanks to free and open softwares on Windows.
